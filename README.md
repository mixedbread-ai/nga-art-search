# Mixedbread Art Search

**Discover over 50,000 artworks from the National Gallery of Art with natural language search.**  
This demo is powered by the [Mixedbread Search API](https://www.mixedbread.com/docs/stores/overview), which uses our multimodal model **Omni** to retrieve artworks that match your queries.

## Features

- **Natural language search**: Describe what you’re looking for in plain text, and Omni will retrieve matching artworks.
- **Multimodal retrieval**: Omni is multimodal (text, image, audio, video) and multi-vector, capturing rich semantic information for accurate results.
- **Public dataset**: Built using the National Gallery of Art’s open-access collection.
